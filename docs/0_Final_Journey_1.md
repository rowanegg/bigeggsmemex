# What is the Most Powerful Thing Learned in This Course?


When learning of the history of the modern Internet and computing, the story centers itself around men like Bezos, Zuckerberg, and Turing, but without knowing, students are held from a large chunk of the true perspective. Although popularly centered around the straight, white male, a wide arrray of diverse figures influenced what we know to be the Internet today. Throughout my journey in HIST 1900C, the most powerful thing I realized was that I can not rely on one single story, and that the search for what voices are missing from history unlocks an important recognition of continued power dynamics in society. 

## The Journey Between hist1900c-starter-vault/1-inbox/2-source_notes/@kumarClayTabletsWeb2013sourcenote and hist1900c-starter-vault/3-atomic_notes/BlackHistory

One of the first readings assigned in class was that of Kumar (2013), describing the history of cataloguing literature. Through this article, the author notes how different ages organized their books, from clay tablets all the way to the digitized OPAC system. Power and accessibility play large roles in these events, as those in power held the ability to control who has the right to literacy. For many years, only the Church and the elite upper class could access books, however the invention of the printing press allowed mass production of literature, thus widening the originally small circle of accessibility. In analyzing this piece, I recognized that those in power have the ability to control the story of those below them, and this could potentially lead to future generations missing key elements from an event.

As Kumar's (2013) article connects to the Black History atomic note, it first crosses through my idea on Culture and Technology. Originally drawn from the previously discussed source, I highlight the relationship between cultural perspective and technological developments, as well as question which side influences the other. However, a factor ommitted from this note that I realize having completeted this course is the idea of power. Looking back on cataloguing techniques, it is clear to see that those in power controlled the access to literature, only helping the general public when it was deemed financially feasible. As I progress through this course, I gradually begin to understand how influencial power can be, and that very little is truly done for the good of the people.

On a similar theme, the journey then traverses into my atomic note on power, wherein I explore the relationship between a nation's 'street cred' and technological inventions. During WW2, Allied countries were racing with Germany to improve their encryption techologies, while simultaneously attempting to develop machines to decrypt messages from the enemy. The nation with more advanced technology is viewed as more powerful, and therefore has significant influence over their peers. In this note, Britain had the better telegraph networks, so therefore they are highlighted as a figurehead of the war.

Power additionally has the ability to influence perspective, thus changing the story for future generations. My atomic note on perspective draws from the Wiegand Amherst source note:  [@wiegandAmherstMethodOrigins1998SourceNote](@wiegandAmherstMethodOrigins1998SourceNote.md), where Wiegand (1998) highlights how the Dewey Decimal System is centered around the white man's perspective, prioritizing certain topics based on one single perspective. Those in power have control over perspective, and can shape what ideas of 'truth' are when examining history. At this point in the course, I am learning how important it is to actively seek out the perspectives that are frequently missing from the story.

As I begin to ask 'who am I not learning about' when examining historical events, I uncover the women of computation, and how their prescence is actively hidden from history books. This idea note expands on [@lightWhenComputersWere1999sourcenote](@lightWhenComputersWere1999sourcenote.md) , depicting how women's role as computer engineers was repeatedly diminished, and when their work was finally accepted as important, they were replaced by men. Prior to reading this article, I had always believed that computer programmers were historically men, but after asking who might be missing from the story I was exposed to a whole new perspective on the subject. My idea note questions *why* women were erased from the story, and how the perspective was so easily shifted from the true figureheads of history.

Drawing closer to the end of my journey, this source note discusses the rarely-discussed relationship between Black Culture and Video Games. After learning about Jerry Lawson in lecture, I sought out more black influence in video game culture, eventually coming across this interview between Russworm and Holmes (2021). The two men explore b-boy and hip hop motifs seen in arcade games, noting that video game culture is centered around white boys. I too was guilty of this limited perspective,  lacking recognition of black culture's place in video gaming. This course's encouragement to seek other stories helped me realize how imperative it is to think critically, seeking out any other potential perspectives on the hunt for truth.

As my journey comes to a close, my atomic note on Black History emphasizes a similar theme from its corresponding previous article, noting the need to take every party into account when analyzing history. The commonly-accepted perspective on historical developments and culture today are centered around the white male experience, leaving out the work done by anyone outside that box. Much like themes of power discussed in this course, stories are shaped by whoever has the power to control others, therefore frequently leaving out the experiences of minorities. From women not being recognized as highly intelligent engineers to black contributions to video game culture, white men are able to shift the spotlight towards themselves, leaving out crucial figureheads from the story. 

After the exploration of my journey through HIST 1900C, the most powerful thing I learned was that power plays a monumental role in who tells the story. It is so important to analyze historical events through a critical lens, constantly asking 'what am I missing?'. Uncovering the lesser-known voices allows a broader, more diverse perspective on history, providing a new viewpoint that can be passed on to future students.
